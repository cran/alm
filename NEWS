===============

* Updated vignette with example using Crossref article level metrics API.

alm 0.1.1
===============

MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* Vignette changed to a link to the vignette on the web, and the file moved to vignettes/ dir from inst/doc dir.
* Added parsers for F1000, Figshare, and Wordpress events data in almevents(). Note that the parsing for Figshare just returns the raw data in list format - there is a lot of text/paragraphs, so it didn't make sense to return as as data.frame.
* Added link to online tutorial to most function docs.
