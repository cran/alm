alm 0.3.1
===============

MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* Vignette now as markdown (renders as HTML) instead of as pdf.

BUG FIXES

* Fixed two broken tests.
* Made `REAMDE` WC3 compliant on Kurt Hornik's request. (#21)
* Fixed bad parsing for `researchblogging` source in `alm_events()` (#35).

alm 0.3.0
===============

NEW FEATURES

* The ALM service that this package interacts with was recently renamed to Lagotto.
* New function `alm_alerts()` added. This function works only with the v4 API, and you have to be given certain status in the Lagotto server to be able to use this function, which requires your username and API key.
* Using `jsonlite` now instead of `RJSONIO` for JSON parsing.
* Now using `httr` instead of `RCurl`.
* Along with using `httr` instead of `RCurl`, all functions now accept options via the `...` parameter that are passed on to `httr::GET()`. 
* New function `alm_signposts()` that uses `alm_ids()` internally, and just gives back the viewed, saved, discussed, and cited summary data.
* New function `alm_status()` to check status of the Lagotto server for any publisher using the service. (#24)
* New function `alm_sources()` to search for data based on source type, e,g., Twitter.
* The `source` parameter only takes one source type now. This is a rather large change. You can  still seaerch for multiple sources, just pass them through the function via a for loop or `lapply` type function. 
* This version of the package now is set up to deal with the Lagotto version 5 API. Thus, the default URL for the PLOS server is `http://alm.plos.org/api/v5/articles`, and similar for other publishers. 
* `alm_events()` now by default drops all sources with no data, toggle this with the `compact` parameter (#26)

MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* Changed license to `MIT` from `CC0`.
* A series of functions now defunct: `alm_pubmedid()`, `alm_pubmedcentid()`, `almupdated()`, `almdateupdated()`, `alm_totals()`. The functionality of all of these functions can be done with `alm_ids()`.
* `alm()` function name changed to `alm_ids()` to avoid confusion with the package name.
* `almdatepub()` function name changed to `alm_datepub()` to be consistent with snake_case naming of other functions.
* `almtitle()` function name changed to `alm_title()` to be consistent with snake_case naming of other functions. Also, message added to say this function will be gone soon.
* `almplot()` function name changed to `alm_plot()` to be consistent with snake_case naming of other functions. 
* `almevents()` function name changed to `alm_events()` to be consistent with snake_case naming of other functions.
* Parameter `mdid` across function changed to `mendeley_uuid` - for the Mendeley UUID.
* Options for parameter `info` changed to totals, summary, or detail - history option deprecated.
* `months`, `days`, and `year` parameter gone.
* `signposts()` function name change to `alm_signposts()`

alm 0.1.9
===============

BUG FIXES

* Fixed some broken tests

MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* Added additional exmple to `almevents()` to get data from the eLife ALM API server


alm 0.1.8
===============

BUG FIXES

* Fixed bug in `almevents()` that was causing the function to fail - due to change in the webservices (#18)

MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* Tidied code a bit and fixed parsing in a few sources in `almevents()`.
* Added more examples in `almevents()` for using CrossRef, PKP, and Copernicus.

alm 0.1.6
===============

BUG FIXES

* Fixed a few tests that were failing due to changes in the PLOS ALM API.

alm 0.1.4
===============

MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* Put a note about where to get rCharts from Github in DESCIPTION file (#16)
* Updated vignette with example using Crossref article level metrics API.
* Updating to using new roxygen2 version.
* Parsing added for new sources: datacite, copernicus, articlecoverage, and articlecoveragecurated (#13) - more parsing needs to be added for event sources, will be added soon.

alm 0.1.2
===============

MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* Added mdid's for PLOS articles, so searching for mdid's with alm() or almevents() works now.
* Added basic handler for new sources in alm: datacite, Copernicus, ariclecoverge, and ariclecovergeupdated.
* Collate removed from DESCRIPTION tile.

alm 0.1.1
===============

MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* Vignette changed to a link to the vignette on the web, and the file moved to vignettes/ dir from inst/doc dir.
* Added parsers for F1000, Figshare, and Wordpress events data in almevents(). Note that the parsing for Figshare just returns the raw data in list format - there is a lot of text/paragraphs, so it didn't make sense to return as as data.frame.
* Added link to online tutorial to most function docs.

alm 0.1
===============

NEW FEATURES

* Released to CRAN
