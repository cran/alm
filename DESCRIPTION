Title: R Client for the Lagotto Altmetrics Platform
Description: An R interface to the open source article level metrics platform
    <https://github.com/articlemetrics/lagotto/> created by the Public Library
    of Science (PLOS). A number of publishers are using the open source app 
    created by PLOS, so you can drop in a different base URL to the functions 
    in this package to get to not only PLOS data, but data for Crossref, 
    and more as the open source PLOS software is used.
